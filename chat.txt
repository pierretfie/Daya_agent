└─> Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open-source network exploration and security 
auditing tool that can be used to discover hosts on a target network, identify 
their operating systems and services, and perform various vulnerability scans. 
Nmap uses a combination of TCP and UDP probes to determine which ports are open 
and which services are running on them. It also supports a wide range of 
protocols, including HTTP, SSH, FTP, SMTP, and many others.

Nmap has several key features that make it useful for security professionals and
network administrators:

1. Port Scanning: Nmap can scan a target network to determine which ports are 
open and which services are running on them. This information can be used to 
identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the network.
2. Service Discovery: Nmap can also discover the operating system and version of
the target host, as well as any installed services and their versions. This 
information can be used to identify potential security weaknesses and 
misconfigurations.
3. Vulnerability Scanning: Nmap supports a wide range of vulnerability scans, 
including OS detection, port scan, version detection, and more. These scans can 
help identify potential security weaknesses in the target network.
4. Scripting: Nmap has a powerful scripting engine that allows users to write 
custom scripts to automate common tasks, such as port scanning and vulnerability
scanning. This can save time and reduce the risk of human error.
5. Reporting: Nmap supports a variety of reporting formats, including HTML, XML,
and PDF. These reports can be used to document the findings of the scan and 
share them with others.

To use Nmap, you first need to install it on your local system. Once installed, 
you can run various commands to perform different tasks. Some common Nmap 
commands include:
• nmap - scan a target network for open ports and services
• nmap --script <script> - scan a target network using a specific script (e.g., 
http-title)
• nmap --os-detect - detect the operating system of a target host
• nmap --version-all - discover all installed services and their versions on a 
target host
• nmap --script vuln-all - perform a comprehensive vulnerability scan of a 
target network

It's important to note that Nmap can be a powerful tool, but it should be used 
with caution. Scanning a target network without permission can be illegal and 
potentially damaging to the network. It's always best to obtain permission 
before performing any security assessments or vulnerability scans.
