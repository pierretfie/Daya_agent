Nikita Performance Improvement Recommendations
Based on my analysis of the codebase, here are targeted improvements to enhance Nikita's performance:

1. Context Window Optimization
Selective Context Retention: Implement a relevance-based filtering algorithm that retains only the most pertinent parts of conversation history instead of the current "last n messages" approach
Token Pruning: Automatically remove redundant information from context while preserving semantic meaning
2. Response Caching Enhancements
Implement Vector-Based Caching: Replace the current exact-match caching with semantic similarity caching using embeddings
Tiered Cache Structure: Create a multi-level cache with fast retrieval for exact matches and fallback to semantic matches
3. Parallel Processing Improvements
Split Processing Pipeline: In the reasoning phase, parallelize intent detection, tool selection, and context optimization
Implement Async Tool Documentation Fetching: Pre-fetch tool documentation in background threads
4. Documentation & Factual Accuracy
Documentation Verification System: Add a verification layer that cross-references tool documentation with official sources
Implement Citation Tracking: Include source metadata with tool information to improve factual accuracy
Local Knowledge Base: Build a curated local database of verified tool information to reduce reliance on potentially hallucinated content
5. Adaptive Mode Selection
Auto Mode Selection: Implement heuristics to automatically choose between basic/regular modes based on query complexity
Hybrid Mode: Create an intermediate mode that balances context and speed for common queries
6. Code Efficiency
Optimize Token Counting: Replace the current token counting with a more efficient estimator
Memory Management: Implement better garbage collection for large processed contexts
7. User Experience
Progressive Response Generation: Stream partial responses while continuing to process complex queries
Confidence Scoring: Provide confidence metrics with responses to indicate reliability
These improvements focus on both computational efficiency and factual accuracy, addressing the core concerns highlighted in your previous discussions while maintaining the agent's functionality.
