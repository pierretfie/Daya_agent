Performing information gathering typically involves collecting data about a 
target or domain of interest. In this case, you've asked for information on how 
to gather information about Google.com.

Information gathering can be performed using various tools and techniques, but 
it's essential to understand that not all methods are legal or ethical. Always 
ensure you have explicit authorization before performing any actions.

Here's a brief overview of some common information gathering techniques:

1. Passive Information Gathering: This type of gathering involves collecting 
data without directly interacting with the target. Some examples include:
* DNS queries (e.g., nslookup)
* Web crawling (e.g., using tools like Burp Suite or Wireshark)
* Social media monitoring (e.g., using tools like Hootsuite or Brandwatch)
2. Active Information Gathering: This type of gathering involves directly 
interacting with the target to collect data. Some examples include:
* Port scanning (using tools like Nmap)
* Vulnerability scanning (using tools like Nikto)
* Manual penetration testing (with permission)

It's important to remember that information gathering should be performed with 
the least intrusive methods possible and only when explicitly authorized. Always
ensure you understand the legal implications of your actions and maintain a high
level of ethics.

If you have any further questions or would like more guidance on performing 
information gathering, please let me know.
