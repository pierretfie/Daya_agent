┌──(NIKITA 🐺)
└─> An exploit is a technique used by attackers to take advantage of 
vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or network systems. It involves finding 
and manipulating these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, steal data, 
cause damage, or perform other malicious actions. Exploits can be used for 
various purposes, including cybercrime, espionage, and political activism. They 
are often developed by hackers and sold on the black market or used in targeted 
attacks. To protect against exploits, it is important to keep software and 
systems up-to-date, use strong passwords, and implement security measures such 
as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
