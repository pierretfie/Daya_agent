scope of your operations and obtain explicit authorization. Once you have that 
in place, you can start gathering information about the target. This could 
involve port scanning, web application analysis, or other techniques depending 
on your objectives. Remember to use stealthy options first (e.g., `nmap -sS`) 
and escalate intensity if needed. Always document your findings and maintain 
OPSEC awareness throughout the process. If you're not authorized to perform any 
actions, refrain from doing so. The goal is to understand the target environment
without causing harm or disruption. If you need further guidance, please provide
more details about your objective and specific techniques you plan to use.",
